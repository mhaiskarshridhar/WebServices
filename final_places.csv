City,Season,Place,Place2
Canberra,Winter,"1. Wander through wineries   ---
		The Canberra District Wine Region features more than 33 wineries, located within 35 minutes of Canberra, meaning a good drop is just a short trip away.
		A number of events are taking place at Pialligo Estate for The Butcher, The Baker and The Merrymaker winter event series, which culminates in The Christmas Sunday Roast on July 31.
		The Christmas finale will feature a sumptuous three-course feast, beverages for the entire family, live music, a mysterious Pialligo Estate goodie bag and activities for the littlies. Yum! 

","2.Go to the opera … at the movies ---
		Frosty winter nights call for elegant winter coats and beautiful vocals. The Met Opera’s Winter Encores season sees an award-winning series of operas captured live
		in high definition and screened concurrently with the New York season. Strauss’s Elektra will screen at the Dendy in July and Puccini’s Tosca in August. 
		So grab the popcorn and lose yourself in the drama."
Canberra,Summer,"1. Australian War Memorial
---		Inaugurated in the middle of WWII, the massive Byzantine-style monument commemorating Australia's war fatalities is Canberra's most poignant attraction. 
		More than just a war memorial, the site combines an excellent museum, archives, art gallery, and library. The Commemorative Courtyard at the entrance to the memorial is a haunting introduction. 
		Inscribed in bronze on the walls of the colonnades are the names of every Australian who has died in war since 1885, and the length of the list is spine chilling.
","2.Lake Burley Griffin---
		Beautiful Lake Burley Griffin is the centerpiece of Canberra. Named for the city's architect, this artificial lake was included in his original plan of 1912, 
		but didn't come to fruition until 1958. Tourists and locals alike come here to bike and stroll along the waterfront paths; picnic along its park-fringed shores; and fish, sail, 
		or paddle the glistening waters. Six islands lie at its center, the largest of which is Aspen Island, home to the National Carillon, a gift from the British government with 55 bronze bells."
Washington,Winter,"	1. Olympic National Park---
		From ocean beaches to glaciered mountaintops, Olympic National Park overflows with incomparable scenery. The park covers most of the Olympic Peninsula, and roads only circle the park with 
		a scenic drive on US 101, never cutting through the park's mountainous heart. Iconic coastal areas like Ruby and Rialto Beach define the rugged western edge of the park, only a short drive
		away from the over-sized trees and abundant foliage found in the Hoh Rain Forest. Other popular attractions at the park include the snowy peaks of Hurricane Ridge and the welcoming waters of
		Sol Duc Hot Springs.
	","2. Mount Rainier National Park
---		An iconic Washington landmark seen from miles in every direction, Mount Rainier is the tallest peak in the state (14,410 feet). 
		Located south of Seattle, Mount Rainier lies at the center of its namesake national park. Two areas of particularly stunning interest include the Sunrise and Paradise regions of the park.
		The Road to Paradise is open, weather permitting, year-round, allowing visitors to reach high elevations for hiking in summer and snowshoeing in winter."
Washington,Summer,"	1.Seattle Center---
		Of all the top-rated attractions in Seattle, the Space Needle within the Seattle Center is perhaps the most iconic. Built for the 1962 World's Fair, the Seattle Center's 74-acre
		campus contains many popular places to visit, including the Space Needle, Monorail, parklands, museums, and restaurants. Among the newer sightseeing options are the colorful glass 
		artworks at Chihuly Garden and Glass and the Frank O. Gehry designed Museum of Pop Culture.
	","2.Puget Sound---
		On the western border of the state, separating the Olympic Peninsula and Seattle, Puget Sound is a watery region filled with inlets, islands, and unique worlds to discover. 
		Some of the things to do in Puget Sound include sea kayaking, whale watching, and visiting the vibrant communities that define the islands. An extensive ferry system accesses the
		different destinations in Puget Sound, allowing for easy day trips and island hopping."
Madrid,Winter,"1.Take a winter walk through Retiro Park---
		Madrid’s Retiro Park is the stuff of fairytales during the winter, particularly on a mild sunny winter’s day, of which there are many (it only really gets cold in Madrid when the sun goes down).
		Take a leisurely afternoon stroll through the park and check out the exhibitions in the Palacio de Velázquez and the Palacio de Cristal. In particular, the Crystal Palace, set against all the 
		bare trees with frosted tips, looks stunning at this time of year and is worthy of an Instagram story.
","2. Enjoy the winter snow---
		Most people don’t usually associate Madrid with winter sports but the city is surrounded by snow-covered mountains that are ideal for skiing.
		The most popular resort is Valdesquí that’s around an hour’s drive northwest of the city (or two and half hours by train).
		The ski center features 27 tracks (three red, 15 blue and 9 green), snow making machines and a couple of cafes for a pre- and post-ski refueling.
		You can also don some snow boots and take guided tours through the enchanting woods, on the look out for eagles, vulture, deer, foxes and other mountain wildlife. 
		If the snowfall isn’t up to par then you can fake it over at Snowzone in Madrid’s Xanadu shopping center instead"
Madrid,Summer,"1.Open-air cinema---
		There are lots of different places across the city that set up open-air cinemas in the summer. Catch a flick on the beautiful rooftop of La Casa Encendida, 
		a cultural centre, or watch a new release in the courtyard of Cibeles Palace, the grand headquarters of Madrid’s City Council.
","2.Hit the waterpark---
		Aquopolis, on the outskirts of Madrid, is a fun water park for all the family. It will keep kids entertained all day long and is a good chance to escape the busy streets of the city, 
		if only for a few hours.You can take the cercanías commuter train from Madrid to the water park, located in San Fernando de Henares, in about 30 minutes"
